     <div class="para"><p>I grew up in the tiny town of Onaway, MI, but these days I split my time between Anchorage, AK, Grand Marais, MI and Lyons, CO. I'm very fortunate.</p>

       <p>Like it says up there, I'm a software engineer and musician, among other things...</p>

       <p>By musician, I mean I'm a pretty good Old Time fiddler and banjoist and I try hard at Gypsy Jazz guitar and 80s hair metal. Someday I'll learn how to make electronic music that at least I would like to listen to.</p>

       <p>By software engineer, I mean I'm a senior backend/DevOps engineer proud to be building this very product and more with my friends at Broadly.</p>

       <p>I also spend as much time as possible out of doors exploring the wonderful wilderness that Alaska and Michigan offer. In June 2018 I fulfilled a long time dream of making a summit attempt on Denali.</p>
